# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am doing a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Mathematics and Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because It's part of my major and I'm interested in Data Science
- I am interested in learning about data science techniques in this course
